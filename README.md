# Air

This is a hobby project I wanted to get set up for a long while. It consists of a 3D air conditioner made with Three.js on the web, that sends instructions to my room's AC.

### Technology

Frontend:
- Next.js & Three.js

Backend: 
Raspberry Pi with LIRC. Sensors are used to communicate the backend with the air conditioner itself.
- REST or WebSocket based backend that receives instructions from the frontend.
